Something is happening to the way we think, and we don't have a word for it yet.

Here's what it feels like: you have a half-formed idea, and instead of spending days turning it over alone, you throw it into a conversation with an intelligence that can hold more context than you can. It comes back sharper. You push further. You branch. One line of thought becomes three, then seven, each going somewhere real. You're not skimming. You're thinking, but across more ground than your mind has ever covered at once.

The mind is going parallel.

For all of human history, we thought one thing at a time. One problem, one thread, one slow path through the fog. That was the ceiling.

It's not anymore. With AI you can run many deep lines of thinking at once. Not the shallow kind where twenty browser tabs compete for your attention, but something different. You chase the meaning of an idea while testing whether it holds while tracing where it came from. You pull the threads together and see things that would have taken weeks to find.

Intelligence is becoming infrastructure. Not a replacement for human thought but a multiplier, the way electricity multiplied what one person could move, build, make. The distance between "I'm curious about quantum physics" and "I can reason about it" used to be a PhD. Now it's an afternoon. The wall between curiosity and understanding has come down.

We are being upgraded, not in some far-off sci-fi sense, but right now, clumsily, through chat windows and text boxes. And the human processor is maxing out.

You feel it if you've spent real time working this way. You branch into six lines of thinking and each one gives you something real, but when you try to collect yourself, something is scattered. You can't find where the good idea went. You go deep on a problem, surface with the answer, and realize you've lost the thread of why you were asking. You sent your mind out in six directions and not all of it came back.

The answers arrive fast but making sense of them is slow, because sense-making is a body process. It takes time and sleep and stillness, the kind where you sit with something long enough for it to land. The parallel mind doesn't want stillness. It wants to branch again.

This is an old pattern. Writing gave us external memory and we lost the art of remembering. The printing press spread knowledge everywhere and broke the church's hold on truth. The internet connected everything and scattered our attention. Each time, a new power and a new cost, the human processor overwhelmed by what it had just unlocked.

But those leaps were about information. This one is about thinking itself. Thought went parallel, and the processor at the center of it is still one mind, one body, one pair of eyes.

Knowledge is everywhere now and thinking is cheap. What didn't get faster is us. The part that has to take what comes back and make sense of it, let it land, let it change you. That's the human processor's job, it always was, we just never noticed because it was never the bottleneck before. Now it is, and the question isn't how to think more but how to come back from thinking.
