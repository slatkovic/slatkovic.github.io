Every technology before this one required you to learn its language. Punch cards. Assembly. SQL. Even the graphical interface — you learned the machine's metaphors for itself. Sixty years of humans adapting to machines.

LLMs inverted this. For the first time, the machine learned our language — not a programming language, but the actual one. Messy, contextual, full of implication. It learned by reading essentially everything we've ever written.

But think about what that actually means. Think about what's in the training data.

Not just facts. Patterns.

The shape of a good explanation. The way a clear question leads to a clear answer. The way context changes everything — how the same words mean different things depending on what came before. The way a conversation between two people who understand each other produces something neither could alone. The way a vague question gets a vague answer, and a precise one opens a door.

All of that is in there. Not because anyone labeled it or tagged it. Because that's what human language is. It's not just words — it's the structure of how we think together. Every essay that built an argument carefully. Every teacher who found the right analogy. Every conversation where someone said "wait, let me back up and give you context" and everything after that was better for it. Every time a human communicated well — and every time they didn't — the pattern is in the data.

So when you prompt an LLM, you're not issuing a command. You're invoking a pattern.

Give it a terse keyword and you activate the pattern of terse exchanges — which, in the data, produce shallow responses. The machine isn't the bottleneck. The thinking is.

Give it real context — what you're trying to do, what you've tried, why it matters, what good looks like — and you activate a different pattern entirely. The pattern of two minds working through a problem together. Which, in the data, is where the best thinking lives.

The machine doesn't understand you. It activates the pattern that your input most resembles. And the patterns that produce the best outputs are the ones that came from humans thinking clearly with other humans.

This is why the people who are best at this aren't technical. They're clear thinkers who know how to bring another mind into their problem. Teachers. Writers. Anyone who's spent years learning to explain not just what, but why.

And it's why the blank prompt is so exposing. There are no menus. No forms. No options constraining the question for you. The LLM just sits there and waits. And what comes back is a mirror of how clearly you were thinking when you asked.

It was trained on us. On the full record of how we think together.

Speak human.
