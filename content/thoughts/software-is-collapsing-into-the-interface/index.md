title: Software Is Collapsing Into the Interface

When anyone can generate features in seconds, features stop being the product. Code gets cheap. The hard part is no longer making the thing work. The hard part is deciding what the thing should do, for this person, in this moment. And when that happens, all of software starts collapsing into one thing: THE INTERFACE.

## The Surface

By interface, I don't mean screens, buttons, or dashboards. I mean the thing that forms between you and a system at the moment you need each other.

Think about a boarding pass. Right now it's static, a QR code you hunt for and pull up. But that's already changing - your phone surfaces it when your flight is close. Now push that further: The pass reshapes as you move, showing you the gate change you haven't noticed, the connection you're about to miss. And when you're in your seat, it's gone. No closing it, no swiping it away. It dissolves because it has nothing left to tell you.

That's where we are going: The interface won't be something you open, but something that forms around you.

## The Collapse

For fifty years, software was layers. Database, backend, frontend, interface. Each one built separately, maintained separately, staffed separately. The part you actually touched sat on top like paint on a building.

When code can be generated on the fly, those layers stop mattering as distinct things. They fold into each other. The backend doesn't need to be a permanent structure if it can be spun up for the moment and torn down after. The frontend doesn't need to be a fixed layout if it can be shaped around what you actually need right now.

Everything collapses toward the point of contact - the moment where you and the system meet. That moment is the interface. And increasingly, it's all there is.

## The Context

So if the interface assembles itself, the question becomes: based on what?

Who are you? What are you trying to do? How much do you know? How urgent is this? What could go wrong? What did you do five minutes ago? What are you about to do next?

The answers to those questions are the system. Not the code - the code is just how the answers get carried out. The real system is the living logic that decides what shows up, when, and why.

A doctor checking a patient's results at 2 AM and a patient checking their own results the next morning - same data, completely different interface. Different information, different actions, different tone, different stakes.

## The Loop

Every interaction teaches the system something - what you need, what you ignore, where you hesitate, where you move fast. It gets sharper over time, not because someone updated a document somewhere, but because it's been paying attention to you.

What to show, what to hide, when to step in, when to stay quiet - the system is figuring this out on its own, adapting to you specifically. It's not following instructions. It's developing taste. A feel for what you need before you ask for it, and what to keep out of your way. That taste is the interface.

## A New Medium

Something new is forming.

The old medium was static. You built an application, shipped it, and people used what you gave them. The new medium is alive. It doesn't exist until the moment it's needed. It forms, it responds, it dissolves. Every interaction is a small act of generation.

Features, infrastructure, backend, frontend - all of it is folding inward. Toward one surface. One moment. One point of contact between you and the system.

Software isn't disappearing. It's collapsing into the interface.
